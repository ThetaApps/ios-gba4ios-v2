The purpose of this repository is to make cutting-edge (not stable, though) version with all modern features included and make it easy for people to check and to test every experiment around GBA4iOS.

Riley Testut and contributors in his repo do well making GBA4iOS better. I created this repo to try give them super-powers with modern tools and providing more responsive feedback on what they do. Additionally I promote great community [iEmulators](http://iemulators.com) and [BuildStore](http://builds.io), the service I create and maintain together with great team for people who wants to dive into retro-gaming with no efforts and to make retro games recognizeable and popular.

GBA4iOS
===========

![GBA4iOS](http://gba4iosapp.com/images/download/gba4ios2_devices.png)

Game Boy Advance emulator for iOS. It's 100% compatible with the most of cool GameBoy Advance Games ever created.

## How to install GBA4iOS on iOS 8 ##

In order to install GBA4iOS you can choose from the number of options.

1. Go and get paid account at [BuildStore. Install iOS apps without Jailbreak](http://builds.io) It has reliable service, responsive support, one-year guarantee and it works out of the box. No glitches, no problems with failing app after update on upper version of iOS. It costs less than $1 a month for annual subscription.

2. Use [iEmulators](http://iemulators.com) and get it free. It is the most known and powerful community of active gamers of old games and emulators fans. It grows fast, but sometimes you may break your app and make it not working after new Apple iOS updates and well-known Apple Ban. Weird things, but great people and absolutely free.

3. Try another enormous count of another sites! For example [GBA4iOS Permanent Mirror](http://www.gba4ios.info/). It's free to install, but have a bunch of ads and app could crash. Another guide is available here at [GBA4iOS How to install guide](http://gba4ios.me/)

## BuildStore (builds.io) usage ##

[GBA4iOS is available on the BuildStore](http://builds.io). It distributes GBA4iOS as well as other iOS apps removed from the AppStore. It allows you to install applications using Apple's OTA technology.  It guarantees one-year lifetime for your apps. Of course, you can continue subscription for the next year. 

The sign up proccess is very straight-forward, but you'd be sure that you're opening the site in *Safari* on your iPad or iPhone and you don't use [Private Browsing Mode](http://builds.io/pages/private-browsing/).

It is easy to use as one, two, three.
